# 📚 U-Know Project
U-Know is the new collaborative learning platform. Our goal is to create a community for learning and sharing knowledge.

The main concept revolves around connecting a backend that consumes a MongoDB database and implementing the frontend using Vite, React, and Material-UI.
This will enable the team to create a highly interactive and user-friendly interface that facilitates seamless knowledge sharing and exchange. The frontend will allow users to browse through available knowledge offerings, initiate exchange requests, and manage their own profiles.
